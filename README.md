# My Personal Profile Site Project

Welcome,

This is my very first Milestone Project. I will be building a four-page **Personal Profile Website** in order to showcase my newly acquired skill in the following:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4 framework

As we may already know, Bootstrap is one of the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.

I will be incorporating Bootstrap as the base structure in order to help me easily achieve one of the most important requirements of this project; responsive mobile-first design. I will be then tweak the Bootstrap framework used in my HTML5 code, by styling them with CSS3 to achieve my desired outcome. 

Enjoy the ride. :rocket: :simple_smile:
