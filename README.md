# My Personal Profile Site Project

Welcome,

This is my very first Milestone Project. I will be building a four-page **Personal Profile Website** in order to showcase my newly acquired skill in the following:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4 framework

As we may already know, Bootstrap is one of the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.

I will be incorporating Bootstrap as the base structure in order to help me easily achieve one of the most important requirements of this project; responsive mobile-first design. I will then  be tweaking the Bootstrap framework used in my HTML5 code, by styling them with CSS3 in order to achieve my desired outcome. 

Thank you and enjoy the ride. :rocket:

## UX

This project is created to meet the needs of prospective employers and clients. Below are a couple of _User Stories_.

* 'As a prospective employer, I want to be able to view your profile, any portfolio, download your CV and have some information about you and your personality so as to help accelerate our decision making process and contact you.'

* 'As a potential client, on visiting your site, I want be convinced that I can trust your work and your judgement so I would like to see at least a previous project and/or view your skills and experiences. Finally, it would be great to easily contact you via the site.'

* As a budding full stack developer, I wanted a personal profile website to showcase what I am able to do to potential clients and employers.

In order to meet the requirements of the users, I decided to begin by brainstorming on what to do and how to go about it. I then started with a rough sketch of what I would create (picture evidence attached, please see <>code section). After this, I created the wireframe design of the website on Balsamiq (pdf file attached) before starting on the actual website construction.

## Features

### Existing Features

1. **Home Page:** This page allows a user access to information about me. That is, my skills, competences and interests. Here, the user will read briefly about who I am and have a glimpse of my personality.

They are also able to navigate easily to other pages on the site including external links to my social media pages; Facebook, Linkedin and Instagram should they wish to know more.

2. **CV Page:** Here, the user will have access to information about relevant trainings I had undergone including my work experiences. These information are uniquely presented and displayed on a timeline for a user-friendly experience. 

Also included is a download link where a user can easily download a full version of my CV for easier access. Just as on the Home page, they can easily navigate to other pages on the site without having to click on the back or forward browser arrows. They also have access to my social media pages from here.

3. **Portfolio Page:** The portfolio page is aimed at showcasing projects I had worked or will be working on so as to prove my competences. Users will be able to click on two different images that are linked to external sites. They can also navigate to other pages on the site including to my social media pages.

*Please Note: The websites presently showcased on my portfolio age are not my actual work, they are random sites from the internet as examples of my future aspirations as I progress on the course.*

4. **Contact Page:** On here, the user have access to a form which can be filled and submitted to contact me should they have a question or wish to work with me. They form had been set such that the information entered must be accurate before the form can be submitted. If not, they will have a pop up message. Also, upon sending their message, a message will show up confirming that their message had been received and that they will be contacted.

Just as from other pages, they can easily navigate to other pages and to my social media sites.

### Features to be Implemented

i. For my Home and CV pages, I look forward to adding more skills, competences and experiences on my timeline.

ii. For my portfolio page, I hope to upload in the nearest future my own personal projects in place of the ones presently there as examples. My aim for the page is to have a gallery of projects I have worked on.

iii. For my contact page, I plan to link the form to an actual email address so I can receive messages from users.

iv. On all pages, I would like to include more information in the footer of my site such as additional navigation to other pages on the site, and a copyrighted signature. 

I would also like to add some animations and effects so as to bring the site more alive and make it more interesting to visit for a better user experience. As I progress, I would like to have a blog page.
